# SparkExamples

This project contains different spark examples i have made to learn Spark

I started by using Spark 1.6.1 compiled with Scala 2.10.5 and then i moved all the examples
to work with 2.2.0

Different examples are provided including:
- EuroCupQualifierDecisionTree to predict which teams will make into the semifinals of Euro2016 based on past data back to 1992
- RandomForestExample , copied from a lecture given by Databrick's Sean Owen
- A bunch of examples for extractign Edgar information from a Quarterly master file containing all companies filinng
- A DataScience examples which attempt to predict Cancer survivors based on subset of medical data. These examples uses different Machine Learning
  algorithm to predict the  outcome
  
The project contains also a bunch of unittests using holden karau's spark unit test libaries
